# GreatPizzaTest

Technologies used:
- .Net Framework 4.5.2
- .Net Web API 2.0
- AngularJS.Core (on a Single Page Application)
- jQuery
- .Net's XML Seriaziler (to behave as a DB, preferably we would've used a SQL Database with Entity Framework or even better with Dapper.Net)

Notes:
- Please take on consideration than in order to implement the AngularJS structure as fast and simple as possible I didn't properly organized the controllers, directives, services and templates in their corresponding directories as it should.
